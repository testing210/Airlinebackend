                        Airline Ka backend. 
Objective: 

We need to build a backend system that can support different features for an airline company. Our end user is going to be someone who wants to book flights and query about flights so we need a robust system to actually help them give the best experience possible. This doc is solely going to focus on the backend part of the system. We want to prepare the whole backend keeping the fact in mind that the code base should be as maintainable as possible.
Requirement: 
- A user should be able to search for flights from one place to another.

    - We need to support pagination so that we can list chunk of flights at one point of time.

        -[v2] we can add support for more filters. 
- A user should be able to book flight considering that user is registered on the platform 
    -users should be able to cancel a booking, and then based on some criteria we can initiate refund for them.

                    Non Function Requirement
- We can expect that we are going to have more flight searches than flight booking. 
- The system needs to be accurate in terms of booking. 
- Expect that we will be having approx 1 lac total user 5 lac bookings might come up in one quarter. 
- So in one day we can expect nearly 5k bookings. 
- Concurrency should be handled, using RDBMS should be a good solution.
Capacity Estimation: 
- storage estimates - 
    -for the upcoming 5 years, 1 crore bookings, 1,00,000 Users, Considering all the users records and booking records take 10 MB of data, the over all 10 TB of memory should be fine for our intial pilot run. 
- Traffic estimates - If we consider 30:1 as the search:booking ration, then at max we expect 50000 search queries a day. (nearly 2 query per second); 
- System should be capable of scaling up at least 3 times the current.
- System should handle real time updates to flight prices, before user make the final booking.
